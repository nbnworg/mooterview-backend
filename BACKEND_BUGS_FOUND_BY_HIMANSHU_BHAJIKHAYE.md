# Mooterview Backend Bugs Report

### 1. Problems Won't Open Consistently (This is the worst one!)

**What's happening:**
So I'll be browsing through the coding problems, see one I want to try, click on it and... sometimes it opens, sometimes it just throws me back to the homepage. There's no pattern to it - it's completely random. I'll click the same problem 5 times and maybe it works on the 3rd try. Super annoying.

**Why this sucks:**
- I waste so much time just trying to get to a problem
- It's unpredictable so I never know if clicking will work
- Sometimes I give up and don't practice at all because of this

**What I think might be wrong:**
I've seen similar issues on other sites. Maybe the routing is messed up, Like when I click a problem, sometimes the authentication check fails or something and it just sends me home instead of to the problem page. Could also be some JavaScript error happening in the background that's breaking the navigation.
